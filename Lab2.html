            <h1>Accessibility of the <a href="https://marcoromapizza.com/">Marco Roma</a> Website</h1>
            <p>This biggest issue Marco Roma has is with its nav bar. The links to the various pages are sat above a  carousel that is showing various images of the products. While not a bad idea there are several contrast issues that become apparent. The first thing I would change is in line with WCAG Guideline 1.4.6 level AAA, Contrast. By separating the Nav bar and the carousel, and replacing the background of the nav bar with a dark color helps highlight where one needs to go in order to use the site. As it is right now the photos bold colors can make it confusing with the thin, small, white font of the nav bar. </p>
            <p>The second thing I would do is in reference to 1.4.4 Resize the text and I would make the nav bar a little bigger or at least bolder and more spread out. The biggest problem right now is how the nab bar isnâ€™t very eye-catching and with how important of a feature, it should be easy to draw your eye to. By making the lettering slightly bigger and the font bolder it helps to get you to see it.</p>
